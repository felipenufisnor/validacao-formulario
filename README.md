JavaScript on the web: form validation and HTML5

In this project I was able to validate forms using HTML5's own tools.
I created my own custom validations using current techniques with JavaScript.
I learned how to automatically fill in address fields with requests to the ViaCEP API. Finally, I applied a monetary mask on price fields.
